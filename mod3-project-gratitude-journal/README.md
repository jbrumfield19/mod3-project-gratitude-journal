Welcome to the Gratitude Journal! 

This is our module 3 project using Rails as the backend and Javascript on the front end.

The purpose of this project is for the user to have a chance to do a daily check-in. We believe gratitude can generate a powerful mindset and this "pause" in their day can give the user a chance to reset and realign on what is truly important.

The first page will allow the user to write 3 things they are grateful for with short suggestions in the text box.

The second page will allow them to view all their gratitude entries and erase any if necessary.

The third page will allow them to press the play button, which will queue the sound of rain and change the background to rain. This page was inspired by Dev Ed from YouTube.

The fourth page is a chatroom. It was created to allow different users to write anonymously what they were grateful for. This will hopefully give people small reminders on different aspects of their lives that they can be thankful for as well.

I hope to add a user feature where different users can log into their own account.
